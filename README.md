👋 Hi, I'm Khunshan Butt, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for Python/Django and a flair for JS. With over 3 years of experience, I specialize in crafting end-to-end solutions, from backend to frontend development. 
My portfolio boasts a variety of projects, including full-stack Python applications, Django REST Framework implementations, and web applications using React, Vue.js, and more.

💰 At my current role at 5Rios, and previously at The BeeLogix and Phaedra Solutions, I've successfully led projects from conception to deployment, ensuring seamless integration and adherence to client requirements. 
Not just a coder, I'm also a community contributor, co-founding initiatives like TechnoJawan and startups like Purzey.

💻 My toolbox includes Python, Django, Scrapy, FastAPI, JS, Node, React, Vue, TypeScript, and various database systems. 
I'm adept in deploying projects on AWS and DigitalOcean and skilled in using management tools like Jira and Trello.

🌍 I'm driven by a mission to bring digital literacy and tech skills to the less privileged and continuously seek opportunities to create impactful tech solutions. 
Let's connect and collaborate!
